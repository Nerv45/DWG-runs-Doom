Hello Doomers!

Here is a DWG drawing file (AutoCAD) that can run Doom the game.
Use AutoCAD 2015 or newer to open the file.
To run the Doom make double click on OLE object (white rectangle not a picture).
A Doom port - Chocolate Doom v3.1
Recomended to download Chocolate Doom to Your PC to avoid launch problems.
A game attached in a drawing as an OLE object.
If the game is not runnig after double click on OLE obj, so delete and reattach the OLE obj (chocolate.exe). The problem could be solved.
A *.zip archive doesn't include chocolate.exe 'cause it's OLE and not X-Ref.

Have a nice hell.
I have a chainsaw!
